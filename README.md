README - parkD App

Getting Started

There are no special requirements for building the app; simply build in either
debug or release mode and build to a device running iOS 10.1 or higher.

Once the app launches, the user will have the option of logging in/signing up or
continuing as a guest. To login or sign up, you will need a valid email address,
a password consisting of at least 8 characters with at least one uppercase and one
number, as well as a preferred permit type (Guest is an option). Your preferred
permit type will determine which lots will show up.

Using the App

Once logged in, the main view has a Map and a List. 

Map - The map uses Google APIs and shows lots as pins which can be clicked to 
display more information about a given lot. 

List - The List view is essentially a table view whose cells are lots sorted by
proximity to the intended destination.

Features of both views:

Filters - Users can filter available lots based on a variety of parameters,
including Valid Permit and Nearest To Me. More filters will be available as
the app is updated.
